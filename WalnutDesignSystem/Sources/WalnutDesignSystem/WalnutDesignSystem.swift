import SwiftUI

/// WalnutDesignSystem: Simple, accessible healthcare design system
/// 
/// This framework provides:
/// - Healthcare-focused colors with light/dark mode support
/// - Typography for health metrics and content
/// - Essential spacing and sizing tokens
/// - Accessible button components
/// - Health status indicators and metrics
/// - Card layouts with native materials
/// - Glucose monitoring and nutrition tracking components
/// - Success notifications with animations
/// - Chart components for health data visualization
/// - Complete dashboard layouts
/// 
/// Design Principles:
/// - KISS: Direct SwiftUI APIs only
/// - YAGNI: Only essential components
/// - Accessibility: High contrast, clear tap targets
/// - Performance: Lightweight, native animations
/// - Modern iOS: iOS 17+ patterns with native materials
/// 
/// Usage:
/// ```swift
/// import WalnutDesignSystem
/// 
/// // Use individual components
/// GlucoseCard(value: "3.2", unit: "mmol/L", status: "Normal")
/// DSButton("Save", style: .primary) { /* action */ }
/// 
/// // Or use complete dashboard
/// HealthDashboard()
/// ```
public struct WalnutDesignSystem {
    public static let version = "1.0.0"
    
    /// Initialize the design system (currently no setup needed)
    public static func initialize() {
        // Reserved for future global configurations
    }
