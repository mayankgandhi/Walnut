/// WalnutDesignSystem: Simple, accessible healthcare design system
/// 
/// This framework provides:
/// - Healthcare-focused colors with light/dark mode support
/// - Typography for health metrics and content
/// - Essential spacing and sizing tokens
/// - Accessible button components
/// - Health status indicators and metrics
/// - Card layouts with native materials
/// - Glucose monitoring and nutrition tracking components
/// - Success notifications with animations
/// - Chart components for health data visualization
/// - Complete dashboard layouts
/// 
/// Design Principles:
/// - KISS: Direct SwiftUI APIs only
/// - YAGNI: Only essential components
/// - Accessibility: High contrast, clear tap targets
/// - Performance: Lightweight, native animations
/// - Modern iOS: iOS 17+ patterns with native materials
///
